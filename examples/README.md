# Stencila document examples

**Examples of documents conforming to the Stencila Schema. Mainly for testing.**

## üìñ Purpose

Each of these documents is a Stencila `Article` providing examples of a particular type in the Stencila Schema.

### Regression tests for codecs

A primary purpose for these examples is providing a consistent set of tests fixtures across file formats. The canonical source for each document is the file with the `.json` extension (e.g. the canonical source for the "paragraph" document is `paragraph.json`). Other files, with the same file name stem but different extension (e.g. `paragraph.yaml`) are generated by Stencila "codecs" when tests are run (and then subsequently checked for changes), and represent the same document, but in a different format. These alternative files thus represent "snapshots" of how each codec is working. This is really useful for automatically implementing regression testing for each codec.

## üõ†Ô∏è Develop

When adding new examples, or updating existing ones, to updated derived files (i.e. non-JSON files) do this,

```console
make examples
```
