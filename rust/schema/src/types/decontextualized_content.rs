/// * MOD OF: https://pending.schema.org * COMMENT: Content coded 'missing context' in a <a class="localLink" href="/MediaReview">MediaReview</a>, considered in the context of how it was published or shared.<br/><br/>  For a <a class="localLink" href="/VideoObject">VideoObject</a> to be 'missing context': Presenting unaltered video in an inaccurate manner that misrepresents the footage. For example, using incorrect dates or locations, altering the transcript or sharing brief clips from a longer video to mislead viewers. (A video rated 'original' can also be missing context.)<br/><br/>  For an <a class="localLink" href="/ImageObject">ImageObject</a> to be 'missing context': Presenting unaltered images in an inaccurate manner to misrepresent the image and mislead the viewer. For example, a common tactic is using an unaltered image but saying it came from a different time or place. (An image rated 'original' can also be missing context.)<br/><br/>  For an <a class="localLink" href="/ImageObject">ImageObject</a> with embedded text to be 'missing context': An unaltered image presented in an inaccurate manner to misrepresent the image and mislead the viewer. For example, a common tactic is using an unaltered image but saying it came from a different time or place. (An 'original' image with inaccurate text would generally fall in this category.)<br/><br/>  For an <a class="localLink" href="/AudioObject">AudioObject</a> to be 'missing context': Unaltered audio presented in an inaccurate manner that misrepresents it. For example, using incorrect dates or locations, or sharing brief clips from a longer recording to mislead viewers. (Audio rated “original” can also be missing context.) * EXTEND FROM: https://schema.org/MediaManipulationRatingEnumeration * ENUMERATION FROM: https://schema.org/MediaManipulationRatingEnumeration
