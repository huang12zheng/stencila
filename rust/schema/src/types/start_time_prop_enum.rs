/// http://schema.org/startTime
/// The startTime of something. For a reserved event or service (e.g. FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to start. For actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed. E.g. John wrote a book from <em>January</em> to December. For media, including audio and video, it's the time offset of the start of a clip within a larger file.<br/><br/>  Note that Event uses startDate/endDate instead of startTime/endTime, even when describing dates with times. This situation may be clarified in future revisions.
